# Add image upload functionality to prompts (2025-12-03 03:41Z)

_**User (2025-12-02 17:29Z)**_

add the ability to upload images to a prompt, that will be displayed in the prompt card. If a prompt lacks an image, then keep the current layout. Otherwise, the first image should have a prominant placement in the card, and the user should be able to replace, add photos and reorder them.
