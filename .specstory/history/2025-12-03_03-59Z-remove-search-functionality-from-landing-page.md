# Remove search functionality from landing page (2025-12-03 03:59Z)

_**User (2025-12-02 17:29Z)**_

remove the search on the landing page (bellow the heading), including the display of search results. We already have this functionality in the search bar on the top menu bar

**Contemplating Landing Page**

I've been considering the user's request to eliminate the search bar and results display from the landing page. My current focus is weighing the pros and cons of this change. Eliminating redundancy is a key benefit, yet ensuring a seamless user experience is paramount. I'm exploring how this impacts usability and if the top navigation search adequately covers all needs.


**Analyzing Implementation Steps**

Okay, now my focus is shifting from the conceptual to the practical. I've broken down the implementation into concrete steps. First things first: pinpointing that landing page file. I'm going to list the files in `src/app` to confirm, then locate the search input and results code. After that, I'll tackle the removal and cleanup phases.

**Identifying the Entrypoint**

I've zeroed in on the likely landing page source file, `src/app/page.tsx`. Now, my next step involves carefully examining its contents. My goal is to pinpoint the exact location of the search component and its related logic. This should set the stage for a clean removal.

**Evaluating the Code's Sections**

I'm currently focusing on the `src/app/page.tsx` file, specifically lines 74-100. My objective is to pinpoint the exact code blocks the user wants removed. It seems clear the search input and button, along with the "Trending" links, need to go. I'm assessing the best approach, considering efficiency and minimizing potential side effects.


**Interpreting User Intent**

I'm now clarifying the user's instructions. Initially, I focused solely on removing the input field and "Trending" links within the specified lines. However, the phrase "including the display of search results" has broadened my perspective. It suggests the user wants a complete removal of any search-related UI on the landing page, even if the search results themselves aren't explicitly displayed in `src/app/page.tsx`. This prompts a reevaluation of the section's overall purpose and function.


**Revising Scope and Strategy**

My assessment now involves removing the entire search section (lines 74-100), including the search input, button, and "Trending" links, as these represent the user's intended "search area." The absence of visible search results in `src/app/page.tsx`, coupled with the `readOnly` attribute on the search input, solidifies this decision. I plan to confirm the existence of a functional search bar in the top menu and also remove any related imports.


**Defining the Removal Scope**

I'm now fully committed to removing the search section, from lines 74-100 in `src/app/page.tsx`, and making related import adjustments. The read-only nature of the input, the "Trending" links, and the absence of an explicit search result display solidify my decision to eliminate the entire section. I am preparing to remove the associated imports.

**Considering Package Refinement**

I'm currently focused on cleaning up the code. Specifically, I need to remove the unused imports `Search` and `TrendingUp` from the `lucide-react` library. It's a quick housekeeping task, but important for maintaining a clean and efficient codebase.

**Updating the Codebase**

I've streamlined the codebase, deleting the search bar and trending links. I've focused on the requested updates, particularly incorporating the display of search results. My next step will be working on that feature.


**Analyzing Page Components**

I've reviewed the `src/app/page.tsx` file for search-related elements beyond the removed search bar and links. I confirmed no other search features remained. Now, I'm verifying the code for linter errors to ensure a clean codebase before proceeding further.

**Analyzing File Modification**

I've confirmed the file content's integrity. My focus then shifted to the search section's removal, and I verified its absence while observing the surrounding structure was maintained. My next step involves a Playwright MCP test, to verify visual changes.


**Assessing Page Integrity**

I've got the visual confirmation on the search section's removal and the overall page's stability via Playwright. Now I'm trying to locate or launch the server. After that, I'll examine the terminals.

**Fixing the File Paths**

\n\n

I've hit a snag: the path separator is wrong, which is causing problems with file access. I'm considering using forward slashes instead, or just checking the root "terminals" directory. I am trying to resolve this now.


**Addressing File Access Issues**

\n\n

My current approach focuses on circumventing the path separator issue. I'm attempting to access "terminals/3.txt" directly to check server functionality. It's a quick test to bypass the original path issues, but I'm still exploring how to handle the "terminals" directory given the prompt's restrictions.

Could not find file 'terminals/3.txt' in the workspace.

**Trying a connection attempt**

I'm attempting to reach the server at `http://localhost:3000` via the browser tool. If that fails, as I suspect, I'll then move on to initiating the server process myself. This seems like a logical next step to troubleshoot this.


**Testing Access Points**

I've hit a dead end, so I'm trying a different method now. I'm going to attempt a direct connection using the browser at the usual local address. Failing that, starting the server manually will be the next step.

**Examining Page Structure**

The structural analysis of the webpage is progressing well. I've successfully isolated the first heading and its associated paragraph. The reference tags are providing clear guidance, and I'm prepared to move on to analyze the subsequent sections.


**Verifying Implementation Changes**

Okay, the page snapshot verified the initial structural layout, specifically the absence of a search bar and trending links on the landing page, as confirmed by `ref` tags. I've also double-checked and verified the removal of the search-related imports and, crucially, confirmed the retention of the necessary `Button` import for critical UI elements. The solution is confirmed.


</details></think>

---

I have removed the search bar and the trending links section from the landing page (`src/app/page.tsx`) as requested.

**Changes made:**
1.  **Removed Search & Trending Section:** Deleted the code block containing the search input, button, and trending links located below the main heading description.
2.  **Cleaned Imports:** Removed unused `Search` and `TrendingUp` imports from `lucide-react`.

**Verification:**
-   Verified via browser snapshot that the search bar is gone from the hero section.
-   Confirmed the top navigation search bar is still present.
-   Ensured no linter errors were introduced.

The landing page now flows directly from the hero description to the "Browse by Category" section.
