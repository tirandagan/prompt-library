# Implement tag editing and auto-complete (2025-12-03 03:51Z)

_**User (2025-12-02 17:29Z)**_

when editing a prompt, the tags should be a 2-3 line text area and have auto-complete for tags as the user writes them. User should be allowed to enter new tags, which are then added to the tags table. convert existing tags to the table and implement this functionality

**Evaluating Tag Management**

I'm currently focused on how tags are handled. My goal is to improve the prompt editing experience. It seems like tags might be managed in a simple way right now. I'm exploring UI options for tag editing, specifically how to make it feel smoother and more intuitive.


**Defining the Scope of Work**

I've scoped out the project. My primary focus is improving the tag editing experience when crafting prompts. I've broken down the necessary steps, beginning with a code audit. The initial steps will involve examining the database schema and UI components. Next, I will look at how updates are currently handled by the API.


**Initiating the Code Review**

I've outlined the project requirements and identified the key files to examine. The current focus is on understanding the implementation of tag handling. I am now working my way through the code. I plan to start with the database schema, then the prompt editing UI, and finally, the API endpoint to understand prompt updates. The goal is to see how tags are currently managed and identify areas for improvement.
